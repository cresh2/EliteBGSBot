# EliteBGSBot
## Setup:
Step 1. Use this link to add bot to server: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=1038218491339218965&scope=bot&permissions=76800

Step 2. Only allow the bot to see the channel with the BGS logs. Easy way to do this is to give it a role that can only see that channel 
and set the role to not be able to view other channels(including ones open to everyone). Failure to do this will mean the bog tries to process a lot more than it should.

Step 3. Set the roles that can use the commands. Go to Server Settings -> Integrations -> Elite BGS Manager. You will want to stop @everyone(click red 'X' next to it) from
being able to use the commands. Then you will want to add the roles you want to be able to use the commands.

Step 4. Enjoy using commands. All commands are slash commands, so start typing with a '/' and the commands will appear. Only you will see the result of the commands!
